# CPD_Recipe_List
My Recipe Book is a cross-platform app for saving and managing recipes. Users can add recipes with a name, ingredients, steps, and a photo taken via camera. Recipes are stored in Firebase Realtime Database for easy access. The app includes an add recipe form, a recipe list, a recipe details page, and local notifications for cooking reminders.
